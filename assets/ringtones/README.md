Place your ringtone files in this folder.

- Recommended formats: .ogg (Android), .mp3, .wav
- For Android custom sounds, also add copies (without extension) into
  android/app/src/main/res/raw/ as raw resources for notification channel support.
- For iOS custom sounds, add files to the iOS app bundle in Xcode.

Sample file names expected by the app UI:
- chime.wav
- soft_bell.wav

These sample tones are generated by `tools/generate_ringtones.dart`. To (re)generate them, run:

```
dart run tools/generate_ringtones.dart
```

You can preview them in the app using the Alert Settings screen.
